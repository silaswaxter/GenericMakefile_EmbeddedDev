"The Tests folder is one that would not have existed in my organizational flow just a few 
years ago. I’ve been rapidly pushing myself to adopt a more Test-Driven Development 
(TDD) development process for firmware. All my test case code is stored under this 
directory. The exact structure I use varies a little bit, but a good place to start is 
James Grenning’s cpputest-start-project on github. Automated testing has become so 
important that every project should include this (and actively manage and maintain 
the tests)."
