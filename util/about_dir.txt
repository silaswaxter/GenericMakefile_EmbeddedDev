"Finally, there is the Utilities folder. Just like with the middleware folder, this is 
often a folder of git submodules that provide access to various open source tools. For 
example, I often link cpputest into this folder. That way, a new developer can check-out 
the project and initialize the submodules and be most of the way to being up and 
running. (I’ve also used Docker for this but that is a story for another time). I will 
also include sometimes the installer for various tools if they are not open source. 
Sometimes I’ll even place custom interface code written in Python in this folder as 
well."
